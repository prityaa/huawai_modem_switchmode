most of the modem are dual role like mass storage(SD) and modem

So whenever they are plugged in, they are detected as mass storage rather than modem.

We need to switch its mode, to detect it as model.

In Windows, drivers are provided to handle this

And Linux having usb_modeswitch utility to take care.
